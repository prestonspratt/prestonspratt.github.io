## Learning Engineer

I specialize in engineering learning solutions.  By identifying the stregths and gaps my learners have, I am able to guide the development of top-tier learning programs.  Learning programs that give the learner necessary skills, a chance to practice those skills, and then a way to measure the acquisition of the skill.
